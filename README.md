# DCA PDF Monitor

A Bash script that monitors the **Department of Civil Aviation Myanmar** (DCA) website for newly published PDF reports. If a change is detected, it logs the update and sends a push notification via [ntfy.sh](https://ntfy.sh).

The Department of Civil Aviation in Myanmar publishes aggregated monthly data on the number of people that travel by Airplane. 
The data is based on the flight manifests and shows for each of the Domestic and International Airports the total number of passengers (and cargo).
Dat is split between departed and arrived number of people for each of the Airports in any given month. 
The data is published on the website dca.gov.mm, but there is no fixed frequency in which it is updated. 
There also is no notification function offered by dca.gov.mm. 
This script will automatically compare the current data publication pdf on dca.gov.mm to the previously checked version in order to signal a change.
Thereby signaling if new data was added and removing the need to manually check the website.

## üìå What It Does

- Scrapes the [DCA Myanmar Publications Page](https://dcamyanmar.com/dcadca/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=29)
- Find the pdf report for the year identified in the script
- Downloads and hashes the PDF
- Compares it to the previous PDF hash created by the script
- Logs the results
- Sends a notification via NTFY to the topic "DCA_Data_Update" to inform if a difference in the PDF (name and/or content) was detected
- If the link text on the website is not updated, but the linked pdf is updated, then a change will still be detected.
